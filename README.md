# Lost in the mountains

Assume your lost in the mountains and want to find your way back:

- Ask the user for his planned return path and give him feedback, whether there are any dangerous sections/obstacles on this path.
- Find the fastest way down (also steepest)
- Find the safest way down (e.g. you don't want to climb/ski a slope with more than x degrees)
